this is a simple how to about runing cry generator

Aiwu:

1. edit src/CRYUtils.cc, change the random number: 
    next=next*1103515245+1000;//was 123345
  I start with 1000, add 1 each time when generating some number of events
  each time I want to generate 10k hodo tirgger events (by calculating the track angles to ensure that the track can make an (H0 || H2) && (H1 || H3)

2. type make under the cry's root directory
   don't worry about the error messages because that comes from running one test script, I didn't try to remove that test ....

3. currently I use "test/testRatVector_v3_1mSize_allAngles.cc" to generate hodoTrig events, each run will generate 100k events.

4. "make testRatVector_v3_1mSize_allAngles" under test/ folder will compile this script

5. ./testRatVector_v3_1mSize_allAngles setupBNL1T.file 100000000 cosmic_event_100kEvts.dat cosmic_event_100kEvts_time.dat

    the above command will generate events, bear in mind to change setupBNL1T.file
    100000000 indicates number of events to run, I need to put a large number, and inside the program it will stop when 100k hodo events are reached.
    filenames contain event information and time information

    everytime when random number is changed, testRatVector_v3_1msize_allAngles needs to be re-compiled! Otherwise the random number effect is not reflected.

just add the filename (testRatVector for example) in Makefile

then "make testRatVector" will do it

change random number in
